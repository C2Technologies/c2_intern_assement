## Submission Guidelines

1. To start clone this project onto your laptop.
2. Branch off of master branch creating your own feature branch, with naming convention: todo-app-yourName-yourSurname.
3. When you're done with building and testing your app, **Push the code** to **GitHub on your profile* - be sure not to push it into the master branch.
5. Include a **README.md** explaining how to run the project and any special notes you want to make us aware of.
6. **If the project cannot run on our side, unfortunately then we will not be able to evaluate it properly - so it is improtant that your app works.**
