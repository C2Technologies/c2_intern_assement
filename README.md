## Installation & Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone --branch todo-app-ernest-matshabe git@github.com:C2Technologies/c2_intern_assement.git
```

### 2. Clone the Repository
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd c2_intern_assement
```

### 3. Configure PostgreSQL
Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally before starting the backend.
```bash
Edit config.json in the root direcory of the project to match your PostgreSQL credentials:
{
    "POSTGRES_USER": "postgres",
    "POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "12345",
    "POSTGRES_HOST": "localhost",
    "POSTGRES_PORT": 5432,
    "POSTGRES_DB": "postgres"
}
```

### 4. Setting Up & Running the Backend (FastAPI)
Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows/macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
# OR
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 5. Activate the Virtual Environment
For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 6. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r ./backend/requirements.txt
```

### 6. Run the Backend Server
```bash
python3 backend/app/main.py
python backend/app/main.py
```

### 7. Setting Up & Running the Frontend (React)
Navigate to the Frontend Directory
```bash
cd frontend
```

### 8.  Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 9.  Start the Frontend Server
```bash
npm start
```


### 10. Additional Commands
