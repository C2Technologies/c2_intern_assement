# To-Do App Assessment

## Overview

This assessment requires you to build a simple **To-Do application** using **React, FastAPI, and Tailwind CSS**. The backend will store tasks in a **PostgreSQL database** using SQLAlchemy ORM.

## Requirements

### Features

- âœ… **Task Management**
  - Users can **create** a task with a **title** and **description**.
  - Users can **edit** a taskâ€™s title and description.

  - Tasks should be **sorted** by **creation date**.
- âœ… **Basic UI & Responsiveness**
  - The **UI must be clean and responsive**.
  - Users should be able to interact smoothly with tasks.

## Technical Requirements

### Backend (FastAPI)

- A **REST API** with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /tasks` â†’ Create a new task.
  - `GET /tasks` â†’ Retrieve all tasks.
  - `GET /tasks/{task_id}` â†’ Retrieve a single task.
  - `PUT /tasks/{task_id}` â†’ Update a task (title, description, completed status).
  - `DELETE /tasks/{task_id}` â†’ Delete a task.
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the database.
- Store each task with an **auto-incrementing ID**.

### Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

- **State management**: Use `useState`.
- **API Calls**: Use `fetch` or `axios` to communicate with the FastAPI server.
- **Task List UI**: Display tasks with options to **edit**, **delete**, and **mark complete**.
- **Filters**: Buttons to show **All, Completed, and Pending** tasks.
